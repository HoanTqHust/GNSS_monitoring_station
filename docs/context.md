# Context

## Overview

This repository implements a real-time GNSS monitoring system focused on comparing carrier phase behavior across two u-blox receivers to identify anomalies that may indicate spoofing.

## Domain Problem

- Read UBX data from multiple GNSS receivers
- Synchronize data pairs between two devices by observation time
- Compute carrier phase differences over a sliding window
- Display visual analysis results through a web dashboard
- Mark spoofing status based on per-satellite trend behavior

## Current Data Flow

1. `thread/ReadSerialThread.py` reads serial data from two receivers.
2. `RXM-RAWX`, `NAV-PVT`, `NAV-SAT`, and `MON-SPAN` messages are parsed and stored temporarily.
3. When both receivers provide synchronized `RXM-RAWX` data by `rcvTow`, the combined sample is pushed into `data_queue`.
4. `thread/SocketThread.py` consumes queue data and calls `draws/UbloxChart.py` to generate base64-encoded images.
5. The `update_image` event is emitted to the frontend in `templates/index.html`.

## Main Functional Components

- `app.py`: web application entry point
- `thread/ReadSerialThread.py`: serial ingestion and sample pairing
- `draws/UbloxChart.py`: numeric processing and plot generation
- `thread/SocketThread.py`: streaming processed output to the client
- `logs/RawDataLogger.py`: raw UBX file logging helper

## Operating Assumptions

- The runtime environment is Linux with available serial devices under `/dev/ttyACM*`.
- The main data ingestion flow expects u-blox receivers to produce UBX data at `115200` baud.
- The dashboard is expected to run on the same host or within the same local network as the server.

## Important Findings From Source Review

- The runtime code requires `pyubx2`, but that package is not listed in `requirements.txt`.
- The frontend connects to Socket.IO through a fixed endpoint, `192.168.5.2:5000`, instead of using the current host dynamically.
- `requirements.txt` contains many packages that do not appear to be directly used by the source code currently present in the repo.
- The repository does not include an automated test suite for the core carrier phase / spoofing path.
- The repo contains potentially sensitive files such as `.env`, `cookies.txt`, and `login.txt`.

## Recent Architectural Addition

- A new `realtime/` package now provides a skeleton realtime spoofing pipeline split into two layers:
  - `measurement_builders`: builds `carrier` and `smoothed_pseudorange` DD frames from normalized epoch pairs
  - `detector_engines`: runs `SoS` and `D3` detector skeletons against those measurement frames
- The realtime skeleton writes separated JSONL outputs under `output_rt/` for:
  - `sos_carrier`
  - `sos_smoothed_pseudorange`
  - `d3_carrier`
  - `d3_smoothed_pseudorange`
- This layer is intentionally not wired into `app.py` or the serial reader yet; it is a standalone foundation for later integration with live UBX ingestion and MQTT/REST publishing.
- `realtime/test_runner.py` now provides a small synthetic test runner that exercises the pipeline and verifies the four output branches are created.
- `realtime/live_runner.py` now provides a standalone live serial runner for Option A:
  - opens `PORT1` and `PORT2`
  - pairs realtime epochs by `rcvTow`
  - feeds normalized epoch pairs into the realtime pipeline
  - writes live detector output into `output_rt/`
- The realtime runners now prepend the repo root to `sys.path` so they work both as:
  - `python3 -m realtime.live_runner`
  - `python3 realtime/live_runner.py`
- The web runtime now also computes the four realtime detector outputs inside `thread/ReadSerialThread.py` and emits them to `templates/index.html` through Socket.IO as `realtime_outputs`.
- `realtime/calibrate_thresholds.py` now calibrates initial thresholds from clean recorded UBX pairs and emits four threshold values for the current realtime stack:
  - `sos_carrier`
  - `sos_smoothed_pseudorange`
  - `d3_carrier`
  - `d3_smoothed_pseudorange`

## Documentation Intent

The `docs/` directory exists to:

- help new developers understand the repo quickly
- identify the main entry points and edit surfaces
- preserve operational knowledge for future work

## Verification Scope

The statements in this file were derived directly from:

- `app.py`
- `config.py`
- `thread/ReadSerialThread.py`
- `thread/SocketThread.py`
- `draws/UbloxChart.py`
- `models/*.py`
- `logs/RawDataLogger.py`
- `templates/*.html`

No statement in this document is based on external assumptions beyond the current source tree.
